# Defining a function to background correct and then crop areas from images used in a PTC plot. The means and standard
# standard deviations of the background-corrected images are outputed as a 2D numpy array. TO RUN THIS SCRIPT YOU MUST
# ALREADY HAVE RUN dark_avg.py AND fake_bbox.py and ALLOWED THE OUTPUT TO SAVE TO THE DIRECTORY CONTAINING THE SCRIPTS.
# Input: (system argument 1) directory location of files to be analysed
# Output: A 2D numpy array with a number of rows equal to the number of images being processed, with means in column 0
#           stdevs in column 1.
